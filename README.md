# Machine Learning - Home Assignments 

This is the repository that contains the source code
for the home assignments of the Machine Learning subject at DEL/Poli/UFRJ

## Dependencies

This project uses a virtual env for python. As such, all dependencies are self contained.
They will also be listed in the `requirements.py` file.
You also need `make` to run the project easily.

## Running

Just run `source activate` to enter the virtual env.
    Type `deactivate` afterwards to exit the virtual env.
    Optionally, you can activate the virtual env with `source ./pyhton_venv/bin/activate`

With the virtual env activated, you can use `python -m linear_regression` to run that module.
